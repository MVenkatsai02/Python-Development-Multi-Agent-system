# AI-Powered Code Development Pipeline 🚀

## Overview
The **AI-Powered Code Development Pipeline** is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to collaborate with AI agents to develop, test, and optimize Python code. It leverages the **GEMINI** model and **multi-agent AI workflow** to automate the software development process.

## Features
- 📝 **AI-Generated Code**: Convert user feature requests into Python code.
- 🔍 **Automated Testing**: AI agent tests and debugs the generated code.
- 🚀 **Production Optimization**: AI enhances the code for deployment.
- 📊 **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: AI agents work together to produce high-quality, optimized code.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MVenkatsai02/Python-Development-Multi-Agent-system
   cd ai-code-pipeline
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Obtain a GEMINI API key** from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2. **Enter your feature request** in the provided text field.
3. **Provide your API key** in the sidebar.
4. Click **'Generate Code'** to initiate the AI-powered development process.
5. View the final **optimized and tested** Python code.

## AI Agents
The pipeline consists of the following AI agents:
1. **Python Developer**: Writes Python code based on user requirements.
2. **Python Tester**: Analyzes, debugs, and generates test cases.
3. **Production Team**: Optimizes the code for performance and deployment.
